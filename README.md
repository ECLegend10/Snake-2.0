Welcome to the Snake game!

## About Snake
Snake is a simple computer game program that requires the users to control a "snake" in the screen to obtain as many "apples" (@) spawned in the map. As the "snake" consumes each "apple", the length of the snake will increase and thus, making it harder for the user to control. If the user hits a wall (=) or any part of its body (*), the game would end.

## Control
Left, up, down and right arrow keys

## Game flow

2) The player could choose to press "Play", "Scores", "Help" or "Exit" button.
  - Play : Starts to play

  - Help : Understand the how the game works
  - Exit : Exit the program
3) When the player entered "Play" button, username will be asked from the player to be store later with the player's score.
4) The player will then choose the difficulty of the game: Easy, Medium and Hard.
5) The player starts to play and control the snake to consume as many food as possible.
6) The length of the snake would reduce if the snake keeps on missing to consume the food too!
7) The game ends dies when the snake hits a wall (=) or any part of its body (*), or even when it dissappeared (missed to consumed the food too frequently).
8) When the player pressed Enter, the player would be redirected back to the Main Menu, so the player could still choose to play again.
